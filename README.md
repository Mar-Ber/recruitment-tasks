## Novomatic recruitment tasks
### Exercise 1
In the first task, a function was implemented that returns 'true' if two triangles in 2D space collide with each other.


### Exercise 2
In the second task, a collision visualizer of a circle (statically located in the center of the screen) and a rotating rectangle was created.

The SFML library in version 2.5.1 was used to perform the task.
The control is done using the 'q' and 'e' keys. The collision is signaled by the object's color changing to green.
